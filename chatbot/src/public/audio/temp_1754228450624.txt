Here’s an overview of the leave policy based on the provided documents:

1. Leave Approval Process:
   - Leave is approved on a first-come, first-served basis.
   - If no one in your team is taking leave on the specified dates, you will have the first approval opportunity.
   - If there are overlapping dates, there’s a 50/50 chance of approval, and you may be asked to choose another date.

2. Carry Forward and Forfeiture:
   - You may carry forward a maximum of 4 days of annual leave in a year.
   - Unused leave will be forfeited if not used by the end of your anniversary year.
   - Leave encashment is not allowed.

3. Leave Application:
   - All types of leave (e.g., off-in-lieu, birthday leave) must be submitted through the system for approval.
   - Birthday leave should be utilized during your birthday month or on your actual birthday.
   - New staff under probation can apply for birthday leave after 2 months from their join date.

4. Team Coordination:
   - Employees are encouraged to space out their leave and check with their department manager/supervisor to avoid clashing with team members.
   - Mentors/managers/leaders must ensure at least one senior person is available to cover duties during long leaves.

5. No Pay Leave (NPL):
   - NPL taken is considered when calculating employee bonuses.
   - Employees should avoid taking more than 7 days of NPL in a year.
   - Excessive sick leave (more than 50%) may affect annual appraisals and bonuses.

6. Leave Entitlement Calculation:
   - The company uses an anniversary period to calculate leave entitlement, which is a 12-month period from the date you joined.
   - Leave applied should be before September 30 to qualify for the current year’s entitlement.

7. Special Leaves:
   - Bereavement leave: 2 days per year for immediate family members only.
   - Marriage leave: 2 days, applicable once for the first marriage, and must be continuous.

8. Important Dates:
   - Compulsory attendance at events like the year-end staff appreciation and Christmas lunch. If unable to attend, staff must apply for one day of annual leave with valid reasons (e.g., on maternity/paternity leave, or using annual leave during the holiday period).
