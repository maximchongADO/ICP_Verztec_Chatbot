Certainly, Maxim! Here's the information you need regarding your leave request:

- Short-Notice Leave: While the policy advises against last-minute leave requests, you can still apply for leave on short notice. However, approval is not guaranteed.

- Team Availability: Check the e-leave system to see if any team members have leave scheduled for tomorrow. If no one else is on leave, you have the first approval opportunity.

- Manager Approval: Before applying, inform your manager about your intention to take leave. Ensure that your duties can be covered during your absence.

- Application Process: Submit your leave request through the e-leave system after discussing with your manager. Approval will be based on team coverage needs.

- No Arrangements Before Approval: Avoid making any travel or personal arrangements until your leave is officially approved.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the application process, feel free to ask!
