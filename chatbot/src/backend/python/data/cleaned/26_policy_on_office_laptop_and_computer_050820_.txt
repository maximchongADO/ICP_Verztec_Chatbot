--- Page 1 --- 5th August 2020 Guidelines on Office Laptop and Computer All company laptops and desktop computers assigned to employee shall be deemed as company property, and each employee issued with a laptop or computer shall be responsible for the issued item. You are expected to treat company's property as if it's your own property with reasonable care. All employees are required to undertake the following actions as part of your responsibility: o For laptop users: Power off your laptop and switch off/ plug out the charger when not in use at the end of the day before leaving the office. Keeping your laptop plugged in all the time will kill its battery faster. This is compulsory to avoid overheating of laptop's adaptor (prevent possible fire) and also to prolong the lifespan of the battery. Please keep your laptop in your drawer before leaving the office. Do not leave it around. o For PC and MAC users: please turn off your computer and screen(s) when not in use at the end of the day. o All LCD screen monitors should be turned off to conserve power energy. This also applies to laptop users with additional LCD screens at your work desk. o For the public spare PC/ MAC, the last user should be responsible for its usage and care at the end of each working day. o If you need to turn on the office computers for WFH mode, please stick a "Post it Pad" indicating "WORK FROM HOME USE, DO NOT TURN OFF" so that other staff are aware. Please also wipe off any dust accumulated around your laptops/ computers with tissue for cleanliness. In case of any loss or damages, the management will investigate the root of cause and will update you on the outcome if any penalty is applicable. You are required to return the laptop/ computers in a reasonable good condition (except for fair wear and tear) when you leave the company.
