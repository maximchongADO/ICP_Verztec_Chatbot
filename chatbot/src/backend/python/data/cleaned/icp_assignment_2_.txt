1. OBJECTIVE This assignment provides an opportunity for students to apply the Agile Scrum methodology to a real-world challenge. Students will draw on the concepts and knowledge gained from past modules to ideate, develop, and deliver a working solution by the end of the assignment. Where necessary, students will learn and apply new knowledge. Students will be collaborating in teams of 4 or 5 for this assignment, unless otherwise specified by the instructor.
2. CHALLENGE AREAS In Week 1, students form teams of 4 or
5. From Week 1 to Week 7, each team is expected to go through the process from ideation to providing the data solution. Refer to the Challenge Statements document for details.
3. DELIVERABLES a. Each team is required to give a pitch of their prototype on 2 Jun 2025 (Mon) to a judging panel. More details of the schedule will be provided nearer to the date. b. Prepare your project proof-of-concept in the form of an A3 poster with the following, • Problem statement (in less than 20 words) • Research / Project Objectives • Python tools and libraries used • Relevant screenshots of mock-ups, wireframes c.
