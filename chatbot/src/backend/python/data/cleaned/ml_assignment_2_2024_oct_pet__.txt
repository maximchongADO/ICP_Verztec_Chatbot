1. OBJECTIVES In this assignment we will utilize the Machine Learning Models to solve prediction problems using Python: • To build Machine Learning Models to solve HR Analytics problem and Airbnb problem. • To train the models by adjusting different hyperparameters. • To evaluate the model performance and document findings
2. DATASETS Please refer to assignment 1 document for the problem statements and data dictionaries for HR Analytics problem and Airbnb problem. You have already explored, cleansed the datasets and build a linear regression and logistic regression model in your previous assignment. In this assignment, we will use the cleansed data from assignment 1 to build Machine Learning Models.
3. SUGGESTED TASKS
3.
1. HR Analytics You are suggested to tackle this problem in the below FOUR steps. Step 1: Load and Sample data Load your cleansed dataset. Perform any additional necessary steps. Provide a short summary on the data cleaning and transformation processes performed. Step 2: Build the Machine Learning Models Develop machine learning models using training data to predict whether the employees will be promoted or not. Build at least two models based on different algorithms (excluding logistic regression). Compare the performance and results of the models. Step 3: Evaluate and Improve the Model(s) Performance Evaluate the model(s) performance and improve the models' performance by: - Tuning the model hyperparameters - Selecting different input features - Adjusting the input data - Other effective techniques Step 4: Summarize the findings Summarize your findings. Recommend the best model and explain why this model performs better than the other models. <|image_start|>ml_assignment_2_2024_oct_pet__page2_img

Each student is to practice the presentation in advance to ensure completion within required time. The recording must include both webcam (clearly showing the student's face for authentication) and slides or codes (whichever is applicable). Select the RECORD VIDEO option and choose CAMERA + SCREEN as shown in the figure below. The figure may differ with the constant update of the Bongo software, hence students may see a different layout but general steps should still apply.
