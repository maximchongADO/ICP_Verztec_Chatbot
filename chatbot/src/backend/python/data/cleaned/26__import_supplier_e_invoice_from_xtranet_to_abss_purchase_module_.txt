5.png<|image_end|> The box below will display after import data is completed. Out of 10 invoices imported, there were 8 records imported with warnings. This is correct as the import text file is designated without the inclusive of foreign currency exchange rate generated from xtranet. What we need to do is to open the respective supplier account at ABSS to check the invoices whether it is recorded successfully as compared to the hard copy we have printed For the 2 records skipped - We have to check these 2 records for the reason why it was not imported to ABSS by opening the "ABSSPlog.txt" file follow the path shown at C drive Since I am using the trial ABSS data file that I copied to my "C Drive" for testing, therefore we could locate the log file in the C drive. However, when we import the data into our actual ABSS data file stored at Account Server, then we should be able to locate the Log file at Account Server drive. <|image_start|>26__import_supplier_e_invoice_from_xtranet_to_abss_purchase_module_img

12.png<|image_end|> In this example Error 192 – Duplicate Supplier Invoice Number Supplier Pimporn Sentira already have the Supplier invoice of "NA" recorded in the past invoice at ABSS purchase data already. Hence a duplicate invoice error was prompted. In this case, we would have to record the supplier invoice into ABSS manually base on the hard copy we printed on hand. As usual, the NA stated in the supplier invoice will replace key for the #1st PO number in the supplier Inv# field in the ABSS. This can avoid the future similar error occur <|image_start|>26__import_supplier_e_invoice_from_xtranet_to_abss_purchase_module_img
7.png<|image_end|> Error 240 – Supplier not found This is New Supplier which we do not have New Supplier Card ID created in our ABSS data before. Hence, we would have to create new card ID in ABSS and record the invoice manually. To reduce this error, we could just create the New Supplier Card ID at ABSS data file first based on the hardcopy of invoice printed on hand before we perform the data import
