59. Project Summary/Overview This report details the process and findings of a cluster analysis project aimed at segmenting a used car sales dataset to uncover meaningful patterns that influence sales, pricing, and demand. The overarching goal is to provide actionable insights that can support a used car reseller in optimizing marketing strategies, improving pricing decisions, and enhancing customer-centric operations to increase revenue. The dataset comprises 2,059 used car transaction records, each described by 19 features including vehicle specifications (Make, Model, Year, Engine capacity, Max Power, Max Torque), sales details (Price, Seller Type, Number of Owners), physical attributes (Length, Width, Height, Seating Capacity), and usage indicators (Kilometre reading, Transmission, Fuel Type). This diverse feature set enables a comprehensive analysis of factors impacting the used car market. The project begins with thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and quality. Statistical summaries, histograms, and boxplots reveal the distributions, presence of missing values, and potential outliers within numerical variables. This step ensures identification and appropriate handling of data issues, such as imputing missing values or removing extreme outliers, to maintain data integrity for clustering. Numerical features are evaluated for relevance and scaled when necessary to normalize ranges and prevent variables with larger scales from dominating the clustering outcome. Subsequently, two clustering methodologies are implemented to segment the dataset: K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering. K-means, a centroid-based algorithm, partitions the data into a predefined number of clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance. Hierarchical clustering, in contrast, uses an agglomerative approach that successively merges observations to build nested cluster structures visualized as dendrograms. Both techniques leverage the numerical features to detect natural groupings of used cars sharing similar characteristics. A critical aspect of the process is determining the optimal number of clusters for each model. This is achieved by analysing model evaluation metrics such as Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and Silhouette Scores, which measure cluster cohesion and separation. The elbow method and silhouette analysis provide visual guidance in selecting cluster counts that balance overfitting and underfitting. These steps ensure clusters are both meaningful and statistically sound. Visualization plays a key role in interpreting the cluster results. Scatter plots and profile charts help in comparing clusters based on important variables, allowing for intuitive understanding of each cluster's defining features. These visual aids support the analysis of customer or vehicle segments that share common purchasing patterns, pricing sensitivities, or usage profiles. The final stage involves comparing the two clustering models based on their performance metrics and interpretability. The preferred model is selected for further exploration, and cluster profiles are summarized in tabular form with descriptive labels. Detailed interpretations for each cluster focus on identifying key insights relevant to business decisions, such as segments representing high-demand vehicles, pricing tiers, or marketing targets. The insights derived from this clustering analysis are intended to guide the used car reseller in developing more effective, customer-centric marketing campaigns, adjusting pricing strategies according to demand patterns, and optimizing inventory management to align with customer preferences. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning techniques in extracting actionable intelligence from complex datasets to support data-driven business improvements.
