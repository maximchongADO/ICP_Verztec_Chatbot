Please take note of the below guidelines for all your client / prospect meetings Basic Meeting Etiquette & Preparation for Professionals
1. Always arrive at Prospect/Client Meetings at least 10 meetings before meeting time. Punctuality is very important and goes to show our personal work attitude. If you know you will be late for the meeting, please ensure you give the client a call to apologize and to inform them.
2. When you are being ushered into meeting room to wait for clients, please take the seats in the opposite direction from the meeting room door. We will want to see and greet clients when they walk into the meeting room, hence do not sit at the seats with our back facing the door as it may be implied as rather rude.
3. Always stand up and smile warmly when you notice the client(s) has arrived and entering the meeting room. Have a friendly attitude.
4. Please do not pass your name card over the meeting table or wait for the client/prospect to walk up to your seats to greet you. Instead, always be pro-active and please walk up to the clients to shake their hand and pass your name card with both hands.
5. Inform the receptionist or office tea assistant to get help from their IT colleague to help setup the projector/AV system etc. if you would be doing a laptop presentation. Make sure audio plug to their system is working to ensure audio from your presentation can be heard in the meeting room as well.
6. It will be good to inform the client earlier in the email that our corporate presentation will need the projector/screen/sound etc. and if their meeting has the projector, and if they can standby their IT guy to assist with the set up if necessary.
7. Before you start your presentation, always thank the prospect/client first for their time today, introduce the prospect/client to your other colleagues (if you set up the meeting with client), and share a quick summary of what you will be covering first. Then you may proceed..
