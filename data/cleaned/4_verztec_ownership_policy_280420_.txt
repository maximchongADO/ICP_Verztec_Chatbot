--- Page 1 --- Verztec Ownership Policy We operate a Work Ownership Policy at Verztec. The main reasons for introducing this policy are:
1. It encourages employees to be detail-oriented, especially in capturing and understanding clients' requirements (*when dealing with clients' projects).
2. Better Quality Deliverables and Better Service Experience for our customers
3. Cultivates the corporate culture of re-confirming internally or with client when in doubts, when it comes to critical client's preferences and project/task requirements. (and to reduce internal miscommunication and misunderstanding)
4. It encourages a greater sense of ownership and accountability, especially in terms of cost management, at the workplace The Policy in Operation The implementation of the policy is straight-forward. In the course of work that you undertake in Verztec, at certain times you would be required to: (1) Perform tasks that involve sample demonstrations of the services Verztec offers (eg. sample translations, sample designed artwork or sample copy written text) for clients and prospects. (2) You may also be involved in requirements capture of details pertaining to client's projects so you can manage them or pass on to a project manager to handle it. (3) You may be tasked to design and/or perform edits for print outsourcing or you may be tasked to coordinate design and print related projects, and that your role requires you to provide specific and proper instructions to external printer vendors. (4) You may be tasked to search for resources and carefully select vendors for projects. These are important responsibilities and you are expected to take the highest level of ownership in making sure that the tasks are carried out well with the right procedure with careful checks. - In event that costs are incurred for services or project samples carried out without official management team approval (*eg. sample translations, sample designed artwork or sample copy written text), and that Verztec is liable to pay certain amount of fees; - Or if you misunderstood the client's requirements (inaccurate capture of client / prospect requirements) and failing to re-confirm the language pair or project requirements with client. (*eg. if a project has to be translated from English to Japanese, but u wrongly assigned it to a translator to translate it to English to Korean, <|image_start|>4_verztec_ownership_policy_280420__page1_img

The key to doing this well is to treat the company's money as your own money. Treat the tasks that you handle in Verztec with care as if they are your own personal tasks! Handle them with pride and make sure you check carefully before moving to the next step. Kindly ask and re-confirm and seek approval from management if in doubts. <|image_start|>4_verztec_ownership_policy_280420__page2_img
