Hence a duplicate invoice error was prompted.  In this case, we would have to record the supplier invoice into ABSS manually base on the hard copy we printed on hand.  As usual, the NA stated in the supplier invoice will replace key for the #1st PO number in the supplier Inv# field in the ABSS. This can avoid the future similar error occur\n\nError 240 \u2013 Supplier not found This is New Supplier which we do not have New Supplier Card ID created in our ABSS data before. Hence, we would have to create new card ID in ABSS and record the invoice manually. To reduce this error, we could just create the New Supplier Card ID at ABSS data file first based on the hardcopy of invoice printed on hand before we perform the data import",
