User: what to do if i get laid off
Bot: If you get laid off, you should follow the steps outlined in the "Offboarding Clean Desk and Digital Handover Policy" effective from 15th January 2025. 

The key steps include:
1. Removing personal belongings and ensuring the workspace is clear of personal and unnecessary items.
2. Organizing work materials, including shredding or disposing of sensitive documents, and returning company property such as laptops, keyboards, employment cards, medical cards, and office keys.
3. Backing up necessary digital files to a designated shared drive or cloud storage and handing over credentials for work-related systems, tools, or platforms.
4. Deleting personal files from company devices and emptying the trash/recycle bin.
5. Archiving important emails and sharing access with relevant team members, and seeking advice from your team manager to forward your emails to staff taking over.
6. Scheduling a review with your supervisor or HR to confirm the handover of files and credentials, verify the return of company property, and conduct a final check of the workspace.

Additionally, you will need to sign an Employment Clearance Form to confirm compliance with the policy and completion of all steps. 

Please note that non-compliance with this policy may result in delays in the clearance process and potential withholding of final payments until all obligations are met. 

It is essential to follow these steps to ensure a smooth transition and to fulfill your obligations as outlined in the company's policy.

User: what is the 3rd rule
Bot: Based on the provided company documents, I couldn't find a specific list of rules with a clear "3rd rule". However, I can try to help you identify a rule from a specific policy.

If you're referring to the "Guidelines on Office Laptop and Computer", I found a list of actions for laptop and computer users:

1. Power off your laptop and switch off/plug out the charger when not in use.
2. Turn off your computer and screen(s) when not in use.

The next action would be:
3. All LCD screen monitors should be turned off to conserve power energy.

If this isn't the policy you're referring to, please provide more context, and I'll try to help you find the 3rd rule.

User: what is the 3rd rule
Bot: Based on the given context, I will review the provided information to find the third rule.

The context provides several sections: 

1. Transcription Quality & Accuracy Checklist
2. Special Note to client
3. Digital Meeting Etiquette Points to note for our internal meetings 
4. Verztec Ownership Policy

The "Digital Meeting Etiquette Points to note for our internal meetings" section lists several points:

1. Respect the speakers 
2. Turn Video on, so we know you are present & in the meeting. 
There are more points listed, but I will stop here as I found the first two rules.

The "Verztec Ownership Policy" section also lists several reasons and rules.

However, I found another list with rules in "Digital Meeting Etiquette Points to note for our internal meetings":
 
The third rule seems to be: 
3. Please refrain from doing other work/tasks. Eg.Hands typing away on keyboard or on your phone. 

So, the answer to the question "What is the third rule?" is:

The third rule is: Please refrain from doing other work/tasks. Eg.Hands typing away on keyboard or on your phone.
